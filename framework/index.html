        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            the paragraph tag belongs to the "block" of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
            line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
            how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place
            your content on separate lines yourself and it will not affect how
            the browser displays your paragraph content.
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does NOT display
            your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in 
            html file.
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.
